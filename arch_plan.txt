We'll most likely have headers for stuff like constants
eg. size of the memory tape (from 30000 to dynamic? 10000? 100? efficient?)
and helper functions

we do a two-pass approach

notes: 

maybe use #pragma once

also maybe not call malloc in the stack implementation and let it live on the stack instead

maybe add NULL checks to all functions inside stack.h
good defensive programming practice

make note of error messages in stack_pop() function.
maybe in the future you'd want to move them to interpreter.c for consistency

for cell value wrapping
if (cell value == 128) cell value = 0; strictly ASCII.

valgrind?

strict mode

std error file



LOOP LOGIC:

`[`
If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching `]` command

`]`
If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching `[` command

Let's take the following code snippet: `,[>+<-]>.`

Accepts input (say 'A' (65))
Puts input in cell 1
Starts loop
	goes to cell 2
	increments cell 2
	goes to cell 1
	decrements cell 1
	loop end
goes to cell 2
outputs cell 2

the first pass gave us a `bracket_map[length_file] = [x, 6, x, x, x, x, 1, x, x]`

Let's simulate

```
case '[':
	if (cell_array[cell_ptr] == 0) {
		fseek(bf_fileptr, bracket_map[char_idx] + 1, SEEK_SET);
	}
	break;

case ']':
	if (cell_array[cell_ptr] != 0) {
		fseek(bf_fileptr, bracket_map[char_idx] + 1, SEEK_SET);
	}
	break;
```
