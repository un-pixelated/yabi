We'll most likely have headers for stuff like constants
eg. size of the memory tape (from 30000 to dynamic? 10000? 100? efficient?)
and helper functions

we do a two-pass approach

notes: 

maybe use #pragma once

also maybe not call malloc in the stack implementation and let it live on the stack instead

maybe add NULL checks to all functions inside stack.h
good defensive programming practice

make note of error messages in stack_pop() function.
maybe in the future you'd want to move them to interpreter.c for consistency
